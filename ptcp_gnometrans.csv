You then continue this with trying to bring the 4th option all the way up to the front, and then the 5th option ,etc. 

Here is an example (we will use letters instead of pictures):

The correct order of this example will be: ABCDEF with each letter representing a picture.

Say you get a jumbled up order of this: DBCAEF.

Going from the instructions I wrote earlier, first do a comparison between the 2nd option from the left and the leftmost option. This will result in this: BDCAEF

Then try the 3rd option to the 2nd. Which results in: BCDAEF

Then compare the 2nd option to the 1st: BCDAEF . Note that there is no change. You then continue this method.

With the resulting changes being:
BCADEF
BACDEF
ABCDEF

You would then try to move letters ""E"" and ""F"" up. 

Basically, just work with a single block and move that block to the highest position you can. Also, remember to keep track of what block you worked with so that you are not making comparisons that you already have made before.

If you haven't already, choose to view the advice of the person who had the highest rewards. They might have the same or better advice than this.
